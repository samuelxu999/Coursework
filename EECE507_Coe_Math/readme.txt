Abstract¡ªThe prevalence of social networks has greatly changed the way by which we access to information and communicate with each other. As social networks are dominating private life of human beings, however, the privacy and security issues resulting from social networks are becoming more and more critical. How to analyze user¡¯s behaviors on social network and to prevent malicious ones that lead to negative effects on private or public? To solve this question, we i)propose a Bayesian data authentication scheme, which evaluates user¡¯s current behaviors on social networks given history behaviors database when anomalous behaviors occur, ii)design a classifier using  Naive Bayes learning method to filter malicious behaviors, iii)show the feasible and efficiency of our proposed scheme through detail performance evaluation.
