We miss the delicious fresh fish from cold clear lakes.
     We miss the taste of thick moose steaks, moosemeat sausages,
     fresh smoked lake trout, and pancakes with fresh, wild
     blueberries. We miss the freedom afforded by a short flight
     to a secluded lake shore.
          The fishing and hunting within 10 miles of our northern
     home was superb. The friendship and camaraderie of our
     neighbors was great.
          We are happy to have had the opportunity to experience
     northern life. But, as we approached the midpoint of our
     lives, we wanted to return to civilization. To pick up where
     we had left off. To enjoy the supermarkets, and shopping
     malls, the fancy restaurants, and gourmet foods. We wanted
     to be closer to the center of things, a few hours drive from
     a major city rather than an all day trip.
          We returned to old friends, and new neighbors. New
     stores, and home mail delivery. Lower prices. Broader
     choices. More to do and see. More TV channels. Several radio
     stations, and newspapers.
          We can drive east or west besides north and south. We
     can dance to live music and eat in restaurants of many
     nationalities.

          In short, we are back to civilization

                              THE END
