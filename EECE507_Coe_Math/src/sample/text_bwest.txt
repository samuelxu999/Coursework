Life in the north is definitely different. A person
     accustomed to life in a large city may  not endure the
     rigors involved. They give it up and move south.
          Many people, such as myself, move north for an extended
     period. In our case it was 10 years. We adapted to the way
     of life. We enjoyed the hunting and fishing.
