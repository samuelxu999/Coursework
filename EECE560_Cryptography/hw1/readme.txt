1.  WHAT IS SNAGIT?
----------------------------------------------------------------------
  Welcome to Snagit, the leader in screen capture technology. Snagit
  offers you over 40 ways to capture content on your Windows screen, 
  such as images, text, video and more.
  
  o  Capturing screens and menus in a Windows program to create
     documentation. Enhance and annotate the image with professional
     editing tools.

  o  Professional image processing and manipulation, e.g. shrink
     screen captures while maintaining image readability.

  o  Saving a long window, even if it scrolls off-screen, with a
     single capture instead of clipping them together.

  o  Creating AVI movies from live program action on your computer 
     screen.  Also record audio at the same time from your microphone.

  o  Creating a multimedia program or computer based training (CBT).

  o  Reducing the number of repetitious steps required to capture many
     screens.

  o  Saving a screen to e-mail it to someone else.

  o  Capturing text from applications with no cut or paste option.

  o  Easy management of large numbers of captures of any type; images, 
     text or video.

  o  Integrating Snagit's capture functionality into other
     applications through its COM Server support.

  o  Capturing all the images from Internet web pages.

  o  Eliminating the need for scanning printer output. Snagit's 
     Printer Capture allows you to capture any application's printer 
     output directly as digital images.

  Snagit has been providing Microsoft Windows users with an easy way
  to capture and print Windows screens since it was first released in
  1990. Snagit has been called, "the print utility Microsoft Windows 
  forgot."

  o  512 MB of RAM (1 GB recommended)

----------------------------------------------------------------------
6.  KNOWN PROBLEMS OR LIMITATIONS
----------------------------------------------------------------------
  o  If you are attempting to open a file that you saved previously 
     and receive the warning: ”filename, File not found.  Please 
     verify the correct file name was given.”, check to make sure you 
     included a file extension at the end such as .png or .txt.  
     Reenter your file name in the File name field with the extension 
     and attempt to open the file again, or find the file in the 
     folder you saved it in by clicking on the appropriate folder 
     location.

  o  Snagit generally cannot capture DVD video displays in video 
     capture mode, but can capture most DVD video displays in image 
     capture mode, with input set to DirectX.
  
  o  Snagit cannot directly capture audio from other applications
     (e.g. Windows Media Player).  However, it is sometimes 
     possible to record this audio by placing the microphone near 
     your computer's speakers, or by connecting "line out" to 
     "microphone in" on your sound card.
  
  o  Snagit cannot capture video from applications on some 
     systems that use graphics hardware acceleration for video 
     playback (e.g. newer versions of Media Player and RealNetwork's
     RealPlayer). It is often possible to disable the graphics 
     hardware acceleration.

     There are two ways to disable graphics hardware acceleration: 
    
     1. Disable graphics hardware acceleration globally for all 
        applications using the Control Panel "System" applet. Go to 
        the "Performance" tab and click the "Graphics" button under 
        "Advanced settings...". Set the "Hardware acceleration" 
        slider to None and hit OK. You may need to restart Windows 
        to have this change apply.
    
     2. Disable graphics hardware acceleration for a particular 
        application.  For example, in RealPlayer G2 select 
        Options/Preferences from the RealPlayer menu. Go to the 
        "Performance" tab and disable (uncheck) the "Use optimized 
        video display" setting. You may need to stop and restart 
        any movie being played to have the change take effect. 

    Disabling the graphics hardware acceleration globally for all 
    applications is probably the easiest way to "fix" the problem. 
    Of course, with hardware acceleration disabled, video playback
    may not be as smooth as it could be with acceleration enabled. 

  o EXIF file format comments and metadata are not preserved when
    processed with Snagit.  This applies to using such files as an
    input source or processing them in the catalog browser.
