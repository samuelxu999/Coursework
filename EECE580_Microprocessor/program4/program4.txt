Using the attached LCD driver, write a program that turns the 3Pi display into a hex stopwatch.  
The left button functions as a start, the right as stop, and the middle as clear/lap (in stop mode, the middle clears the time; 
in stop mode, it freezes the display but the counter keeps counting in the background).  
The display should show the seconds and milliseconds, in hex, separated by colons.  
Seconds should count modulo-60 and milliseconds modulo-1000.  
Create an interrupt-based driver using a timer module to obtain 1ms timing update of the counter.
